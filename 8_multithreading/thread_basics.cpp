/*
Multithreading and multiprocessing are both techniques for achieving concurrency in C++, but 
they differ in how they utilize system resources.

- Multiprocessing involves creating multiple independent processes, each with its own memory 
space and resources.
- Multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process. These threads share 
the same memory space and resources of the parent process.

## ðŸ”§ Optimal Use Cases

| Use Case                                  | Best Approach          | Why                                              |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tasks with shared data or memory          | Threads                | Share memory easily, low overhead               |
| Completely independent tasks              | Processes or Threads   | Either works; processes if isolation is important |
| IO-bound tasks (e.g., waiting on disk/network) | Many threads        | Threads can sleep while waiting                 |
| CPU-bound tasks (e.g., calculations)      | Threads = CPU cores    | Too many threads cause context switching overhead |
